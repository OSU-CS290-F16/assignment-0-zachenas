		<h3>(9/23/16) - Blog entry no. 1</h3>
		<p>This assignment was super simplistic from a coding perspective. Seeing as <br>
		   I was already familiar with HTML, the <i>index.html</i> and <i>blog.html</i> (this file) <br>
		   were a breeze. The challenging part for me was becoming familiar with gitHub <br>
		   and my personal webspace (which I didn't even know existed). <br><br>
