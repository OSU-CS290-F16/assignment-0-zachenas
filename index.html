		<ul>
			<li>On a scale from 0-10, I am around a 7 or an 8. I have worked with HTML <br>
			      on many occasions; however, it has been a while since I have written <br>
			      straight-up HTML code. To be honest, its kinda hard not adding the CSS.<br><br></li>
            <li>At the end of this class I hope to have solidfied my knowledge of HTML/CSS <br>
                  and hopefully gained a better understanding of Javascript and other such <br>
                  languages. Becoming familiar with GitHub would be nice too.<br><br></li>
            <li>Yes, I have signed up for Piazza.<br><br></li>
            <li>I am usually a pretty boring guy. The only thing that is somewhat interesting <br>
                  about me is that I am somewhat ambidextrous. I am right handed for the most part; <br>
                  however, I play guitar left handed. I can also bowl, play bocci ball, play tennis, <br>
                  and shoot a bow and arrow left handed.</li>
